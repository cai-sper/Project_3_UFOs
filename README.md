# Project_3_UFO

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive web-based interface for exploring UFO sighting data. By visualizing the data on maps and through comparisons, the project aims to provide insights into UFO sightings over time and locations, fostering public interest and engagement in the topic.

## Technologies

- Flask
- MongoDB
- Leaflet (for mapping)
- Plotly (for data visualization)
- HTML
- JavaScript

## Project Description

The Project_3_UFO aims to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to explore UFO sighting data through interactive maps and visual comparisons. The project utilizes Flask, a web framework, to serve API endpoints for different views. The main features include:

1. **Map View**: This view presents UFO sightings on an interactive map using Leaflet, a JavaScript mapping library. Users can see the geographical distribution of sightings and interact with markers to view details.

2. **Yearly Comparison**: This view displays a chart using Plotly to visualize the yearly distribution of UFO sightings. The data is aggregated by year and presented in a bar chart.

3. **Monthly Comparison**: Similar to the yearly view, this displays a chart showing the monthly distribution of sightings over time but in a line graph.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Access Raw Data: Explore the UFO sighting data in the `data` folder.
3. Run the Flask App: Open a terminal, navigate to the repository folder, and run the Flask app ussing `python app.py`
4. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
